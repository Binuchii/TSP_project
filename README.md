# TSP_project: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Evolutionary Search (Genetic Algorithms)

To Run the Algorithm

1. Open the "bestParameterV2.py" file. This file takes problem file as an input. You can add more tsp files to it as you like. It checks to see if the file exits, then procedes.
    Uses a grid search to find the best parameters (example parameters are already in the file), you can add or take out some of the parameters. If you want to remove or add a parameter completely make sure to update the ga and the results.append
    Once this is all done and configured, you can run the file, once it finishes compiling it would generate a csv file to showcase the results ordered by best distance.

2. To produce the graphs you can use the "experiments.py" file. Edit the configurations for you parameters as you like.
    Pick the tsp file you want as your problem file. It only works one at a time.
    Then run the file.
